## Jack Overton

After leaving college I feel into the family trade, (Stonemasonry) 7 years later I felt that I wanted a new challenge. I looked into Makers and attended a couple of events. Since that it always been in my mind that I wanted to become a developer since. Seeing what could be achieved in such little time inspired me.

## Skills

Attention to detail - I have always had this quality before I started work, but during work, this grew even more. I would always be giving Memorials quality control checks before and after fixing them in the cemetery's to make sure it was perfect for the customer.

Team player - Having worked at a big company it's important to be able to speak and communicate effectively. This could be actively listening to the members about their suggestions on the tasks ahead. Also, the ability to work with different members each day helped me learn more, as I picked up skills from each member. This shows my adaptability in the workplace.

Commitment - I have worked 6 days a week for the past 4 years, in doing so this shows my enthusiasm and my work ethic towards getting the job done. 

Working under pressure - I can work under pressure as many of a time have I had to get the work done by a closing deadline date. An example of this is over the busy periods an example Christmas being one of them and getting all the work done before Christmas day.
