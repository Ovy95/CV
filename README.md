As of graduating the 12-week intensive Makers course, I feel, I have grown as a person and as a developer. I feel more confident in my skills as a Junior full stack Developer and ready to expand and grow my knowledge. One thing I feel, I enjoyed learning about was creating tests, to surpass effective and clean code. Among improving my skills, I learned a lot of coding principles, like DRY, SRP, OOP, MVC and much more.

I'm currently looking for a career in Software Development in London or Essex areas, where I can show off my skills and learn from other Developers in real-life situations and scenarios.

| Thermostat | This was our first JavaScript project at Makers. It was to create the logic for a thermostat in Js being able to interact with it increasing and decreasing the temperature. This included having a min and max temperature as well as power-saving modes which would also restrict temperatures. Along with this, there is a Weather app Api which by default gets the current temperature in London, this can be changed by using the search box to enter in another location to get the temperature of that location. | JavaScript, Jasmine, Open Weather app Api     | 



## Skills

**Quick Learner** - We used react for in our final project, in less then 2 weeks we was able to complete a fully working game using react as well as test it having never used Jest or Enzyme before.

**Attention to detail**- I have always had this quality before I started my old place of work, this grew even more. I would always be giving Memorials quality control checks before and after fixing them in the cemetery's to make sure it was perfect for the customer, as well as testing perviously fixed memorials if they was safely fixed. This really helped during my time at Makers especially it comes to making tests, or learning new languages. 

**Team player** - Having worked at a big company it's important to be able to speak and communicate effectively. This could be actively listening to the members about their suggestions on the tasks ahead. Also, the ability to work with different members each day helped me learn more, as I picked up more skills from each member and share on that knowledge with others. So when it was Makers group projects weeks. I already had these skills which really helped for each of the projects and allowed me to improve these even more. Working in different teams gave me the benefit of being able to ability to communicate effectively with different types of people in the workforce and at Makers. 

**Commitment** - I have worked 6 days a week for the past 4 years before joining the course, in doing so this shows my enthusiasm and my work ethic towards getting the job done. Also having the same Saturday job since college shows this. 

**Working under pressure** - An example of this was the final project weeks we had one day, due to easter put pressure on before we started, but because of our excellent planning and effective communication were able to come up with a polished finished project.
